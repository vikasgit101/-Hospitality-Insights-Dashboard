## üîç Project Objectives

The main goals of this project were:

‚úÖ Build a **professional-grade Power BI dashboard** using real-world-like structured data  
‚úÖ Enable stakeholders to **explore bookings and performance** across hotels and room categories  
‚úÖ Apply **data modeling best practices** (Star Schema) for clean, scalable, and efficient analysis  
‚úÖ Demonstrate storytelling with data through clean, actionable visualizations

## üß© Data Model & Schema Design

This project follows a **Star Schema**, separating facts from dimensions for optimal analytical performance.

### üóÇÔ∏è Tables Used:

| Table Name                  | Type        | Description |
|----------------------------|-------------|-------------|
| `fact_aggregated_bookings` | Fact Table  | Contains transactional booking data like occupancy, revenue, and booking dates |
| `dim_hotels`               | Dimension   | Metadata about each hotel such as name, city, state, hotel group |
| `dim_rooms`                | Dimension   | Contains room type, capacity, rate type, and pricing |
| `dim_date`                 | Dimension   | Full calendar table supporting time-series analysis (day, month, quarter, year) |

### üîó Key Relationships:
- `BookingDate` links `fact_aggregated_bookings` to `dim_date`
- `HotelID` links bookings to `dim_hotels`
- `RoomID` links bookings to `dim_rooms`

These relationships allow **intuitive slicing and dicing** of data across multiple business views.
